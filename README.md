# Zeitgeist
## Summary
This project is a WIP.

The current vision for **Zeitgeist** is for it to be a collaborative worldbuilding and note-taking tool, primarily for players and GMs _(gamemasters)_ of TTRPGs _(tabletop role playing games)_ to efficiently contribute to a collection of organised information and notes. GMs can also use this tool to inform their players in a controlled and efficient way so as to limit their knowledge on the setting to keep the secrets hidden until a dramatic reveal.
This tool could also be used by writers in order to organise their setting information in a readable and compartmentalised fashion.

## Features
### Lightning Fast Navigation
A goal of this project is to create a beautiful user interface while keeping loading and superfluous animations to a minimum. To accomplish this, the project is being developed in REACT.

### Users and Permissions
Users can be set to possess different permissions by the GM. This is to allow further granularity of control amongst users. Co-GMs and spectators are both examples of where a GM might want to allow someone higher or lower control. These permissions should include viewing pages, creating folders and pages, deleting folders and pages, moving pages, and  

### Structure and Custom Folders
Custom structuring and folders will allow a degree of customisability for users, so they can lay out their setting in a way that makes sense to them. A sidebar acting as an index will provide quick navigation to all information that is accessible to the user.

### Hidden Information
Some users may want to restrict certain information from other users, this is where the "Hidden" status comes in. Each page can be assigned a a "Hidden" status that corresponds to a user, which will hide the existance of the page from the selected user. Pages can also be given visibility-tags, which if a user does not share then the page will be hidden e.g. If a page has the "Illuminati" visibility-tag, and a user does not also have the same "knowledge-tag", then the page will be hidden.

### Links
Text within pages can be made into links that allow quick navigation to elements elsewhere. This lets players quickly come to grips with concepts within a complex setting with multiple interweaving elements.

### Directed Sharing
Users may "share" pages with the "shareable" tag to others in order to share access to the information.

### Timelines
A setting may have multiple timelines in order to show when events occurred in relation to each other. Multiple timelines allows a controllable level of scope, for example the setting may need a primary timeline that depicts main events, but tertiary timelines may be helpful to understand the development of an organisation or nation without diluting the pertinence of the events within the main timeline, for example.
